OneBang turns html attributes starting with an exclamation mark into an easy way to execute functions and manipulate the DOM. OneBang comes with some simple functions already included.

## Installation

OneBang is a script designed for used in the browser, and integration of OneBang into the front-end of projects is very simple.

> OneBang is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onebang) and [bower](https://bower.io/). Using one of these services is recommended. This project has been tested and works with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). All prepackaged code is located in the __dist__ folder.

```sh
$ npm install --save onebang
$ bower install --save onebang
```

> OneBang is also available from [Github](https://github.com/teamtofu/onebang). Please use a release rather than the master branch in order to ensure a stable version of the code.

## Example

Before
```html
<div !id:example>
    <div !id:test !c:testclass !s:color:red>
        <i !i:fa:code></i> Test
    </div>
    <a !#:test>Scroll</a>
</div>
```

After
```html
<div id="example">
    <div id="test" class="testclass" style="color:red;">
        <i class="fa fa-code"></i> Test
    </div>
    <a href="#test">Scroll</a>
</div>
```

This is just a sample of the functions provided. Check out all of the OneBang functions [here](https://onebang.js.org/#1-functions) to see what else can be done.

## Usage

```html
<script src="onebang.js"></script> <!--Automatically adds window.onebang-->
```

```js
var settings = {};
onebang(/* optional settings */ settings); //This starts processing.
```

Processing happens automatically when the document's body is updated [for most browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=mutationobserver).
